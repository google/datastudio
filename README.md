<a href="https://travis-ci.org/googledatastudio/community-connectors"><img src="https://travis-ci.org/googledatastudio/community-connectors.svg?branch=master" alt="Build Status"></a>

This repository contains open source community connectors for [Google Data
Studio](https://datastudio.google.com).

## Community Connectors

[Community
Connectors](https://developers.google.com/datastudio/connector/overview) are
developed using [Apps Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/) and
let users fetch data from external sources into their Data Studio dashboards.

### Submit your own open source Community Connector

Send us a [pull request](https://github.com/googledatastudio/community-connectors) to
include your own Community Connector in this repository. Note that the `README`
will be updated to follow the same format as the other connectors in this
repository. The Data Studio Developer Relations team will also create and manage
a deployment for the connector.
