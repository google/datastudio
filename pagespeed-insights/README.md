  use of a third-party 'key' based authentication.
- **error handling and messaging** Example of using [error handling] methods
  and providing useful error messages to users.
- **using a 3rd party api which returns the configuration as part of the data
  studio results** The connector uses a 3rd party api to get the page speed
  score, and also returns the configuration which was set by the user as a
  custom dimension.

   to be displayed in a table.

   goes over quota.
4. Add Configuarable cacheing using Data Studio api
